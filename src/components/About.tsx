                I'm a dedicated B.Tech student specializing in Cyber Security at GITAM (Deemed to be University), 
                with a strong interest in cybersecurity that began during the lockdown period. Since then, 
                I've been actively exploring the fieldâ€”both academically and practically.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-light-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Throughout my academic journey at GITAM, I've actively contributed to the CYSEC Club, 
                gaining hands-on experience in cybersecurity. By organizing events and participating in 
                CTF competitions, I've built both technical expertise and management skills.

              <p className="text-lg text-light-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Outside of academics, I enjoy anime and gaming, which help me stay creative and focused. 
                I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges in the world of cybersecurity. 
                My achievement of reaching the Top 50 in TCS Hackquest 9 reflects my dedication to excellence.
